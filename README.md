What is NLP?
---

**Natural Language Processing** or NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages.

> A 2019 Statista report reveals that the NLP market will increase to 43.9 billion dollars by 2025.

Most of us use NLP business applications every day without even knowing it. Spell-checkers, online search, translators, voice assistants—almost all of these include natural language processing technology. 

> Here is a brief breakdown of various NLP tasks performed by modern NLP software.

- Converting text to lowercase
- Removing HTML Tags
- Removing accented characters
- Expanding Contractions
- Removing Special Characters
- Stemming
> Stemming is a method of normalization of words in Natural Language Processing. It is a technique in which a set of words in a sentence are converted into a sequence to shorten its lookup. In this method, the words having the same meaning but have some variations according to the context or sentence are normalized.

- Lemmatization
> Stemming algorithm works by cutting the suffix from the word. In a broader sense cuts either the beginning or end of the word.


> On the contrary, Lemmatization is a more powerful operation, and it takes into consideration morphological analysis of the words. It returns the lemma which is the base form of all its inflectional forms. In-depth linguistic knowledge is required to create dictionaries and look for the proper form of the word. Stemming is a general operation while lemmatization is an intelligent operation where the proper form will be looked in the dictionary. Hence, lemmatization helps in forming better machine learning features.

- StopWords




Project presentation

The project consists in processing the comments related to the different hotels of a french Dataset. You can find the dataset directly on my branch.

The notation takes two values: 0 and 1 

> 0 : the comment is positive
> 1 : the comment is negative

The final goal of the project is to build a Word Cloud in order to identify the most recurrent words among the positive and negative comments.



## Word Cloud in Python

**Word Clouds** are visual displays of text data – simple text analysis. Word Clouds display the most prominent or frequent words in a body of text (such as a State of the Union Address).

You can find an example of word cloud below:
